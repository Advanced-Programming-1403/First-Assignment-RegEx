# First Assignment - RegEx

Enough of algorithms! Let's dive into a practical development tool called **RegEx** (Regular Expressions).

## What is RegEx?

*RegEx* is short for **Regular Expressions**. It is used to detect or validate specific patterns within a string, helping us find substrings that match a desired format.

> Imagine developing a website and designing a sign-up page. Youâ€™ll want to check whether the email entered by the user is valid. What about the password?
> Or perhaps you need to scan all incoming traffic to detect profanity or sensitive information?

With **RegEx**, all of this becomes easy and efficient! It saves developers time and improves performance by eliminating unnecessary conditional checks.

    <img src="cat.jpg" width="80%" alt="RegEx Cat" />
</div>


## Getting Started

Now that you know the power of RegEx, let's begin!

Follow the same structured approach as in the previous assignments:

1. **Research and learn** about regular expressions, their syntax, and formats.
2. **Complete the code** by following the provided descriptions.
3. **Pass all tests** in the `test/java` folder.
4. **Add your mentor as a collaborator** to your repo so they can review your work.

### Notes

- Each method in `Exercises.java` has a different return type, so be mindful of your implementation.
- RegEx syntax can vary across different enginesâ€”make sure to learn how **Java's RegEx** works specifically.
